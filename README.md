# Age of Empires II unit versus

Just some fun with the api made by https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/docs/

- Basically displays all the units of the api and let the user choose between two of them
- Then engage a battle between the units taking in consideration their Life, Attack and sword/pierce armor
- Now handles range units stats ; A ranged unit is unreachable while its opponent is not close to him.
